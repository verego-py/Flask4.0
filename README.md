The name of my project is "DogSearcher Web application"

The goal of the project is to create a website for finding lost pets.
Mechanics: The user registers his pet and receives an individual code, which must be somehow placed on the dog (collar, tattoo, etc.). The person who finds a pet with an individual code enters it on the website and receives all the necessary information about the dog and the contact of the owner.
Structure:
• app.py It is responsible for the operation of the site and includes initialization of all pages (@app.route()) and works with a database containing information about dogs (class DogList(db.Model))
• all html templates are based on a template base.html , containing a header, block content, and footer. The header and footer are taken from the bootstrap project. 
• Each template has its own individual functions and components
• main.css contains the styles necessary to improve the appearance and clarity of the site.
Tasks:
1. implement all of the above components of the structure
2. Make the project publicly available 
3. Using the media to attract customers.
4. Develop the functionality of the project

To create a project, you need access to the Internet to search for templates and files for the appearance of projects, as well as access to the Yandex LMS educational system
